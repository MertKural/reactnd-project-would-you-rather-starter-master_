5)Create a new question
6)Display the leader board
7)Disyplay the questions voting percentages after responding to it

To run the app correctly user must run npm install and after that s/he can react the app via local:/3000 by running npm start command

    5.1)_Data: This fake database is given at the very beginning of the course as well as the simple methods with it. (The detailed info about the _DATA and provided methods are in the below)
    5.2)Api: To react the _Data methos Api layer is written

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data. The only thing you need to edit in the ` _DATA.js` file is the value of `avatarURL`. Each user should have an avatar, so you’ll need to add the path to each user’s avatar.

Using the provided starter code, you'll build a React/Redux front end for the application. We recommend using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

## Data

There are two types of objects stored in our database:

* Users
* Questions

### Users

Users include:

| Attribute    | Type             | Description           |

| avatarURL  | String           | The path to the image file |
| questions | Array | A list of ids of the polling questions this user created|
| answers      | Object         |  The object's keys are the ids of each question this user answered. The value of each key is the answer the user selected. It can be either `'optionOne'` or `'optionTwo'` since each question has two options.
